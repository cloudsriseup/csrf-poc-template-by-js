# Introduction: #
CSRF PoC template is a JavaScript code which is very useful for security researchers and simplifies the art of creating CSRF Proof of Concepts. I also think this template will help the developers and security learners to see how a CSRF attack works; then they can improve the protection methods and also the attack techniques. If you do not have any knowledge about CSRF please read these references first:

# What is inside? #
This template has been written in JavaScript language. Although this code is not free of fault, it is working quite well for me. Please send me your suggestions and bugs through my email or my blog. I will try to fix and improve this code whenever I receive your feedback and also have free time.

I wanted to write this code as simple as possible, and it was around 10 lines of code at first. However, by adding more features during the time, it became more complicated. But, don’t worry; you do not need to understand the JavaScript codes as you can set all of your favorite modes in the “Configuration” section. However, I think the codes are clear enough for those who are familiar with JavaScript if they want to modify it as well.
